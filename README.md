# Candy Crush Clone

This is a simple Candy Crush base game clone built with React JS, Tailwind CSS, and vanilla JavaScript for game logic.

## Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: React JS - for building the user interface and managing component interactions.
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS - for applying styles quickly and responsively.
- **Game Logic**: JavaScript - for implementing core gameplay mechanics.

## Components

- **Board**: Renders the game board with a grid of squares containing candy sprites.
- **Candy**: Individual candy component with properties like color and type.
- **Swap**: Handles user interaction for swapping adjacent candies by drag and drop.
- **Match Detection**: Detects horizontal and vertical lines of matching candies.
- **Scoring**: Tracks points earned based on matches and special candy effects.
- **Animations**: Handles animations for candy swapping, clearing lines, and cascading candies.
- **Sound Effects**: Adds auditory feedback for game events such as matching candies or clearing lines.

## Game Logic

- **Swapping**: Users can swap adjacent candies.
- **Matching**: Lines (horizontal or vertical) of three or more candies of the same color are cleared.
- **Cascading**: Cleared candies disappear, and candies above fall down, potentially creating new matches.
- **Scoring**: Points awarded based on the number of candies cleared.

## Tailwind CSS Benefits

- **Rapid Prototyping**: Quickly style UI elements with pre-built classes.
- **Responsiveness**: Built-in responsive utilities for different screen sizes.
- **Customization**: Ability to tailor styles to your specific needs.
